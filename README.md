Deep learning techniques used in popular Machine learning datasets

1. Iris dataset using Keras
  Observation: 
    1. Random number is my computer(win10) and Ubuntu P2 system results in 4-10% diviation in accuracy.
    2. My Model accuracy 94~% was the best i got after trying 15-20 different approaches across internet.
    
2. PIMA Diabetes dataset using Keras
  Observation:
    1. When applying same technique as Iris, it fetched me 58% accuracy. Very bad considering decision tree and random forest gives 70-74.5% accuracy
    2. After doing multiple adjustment the best i got was about 72-73%
    3. Then when i researched on PIMA, i got to know from Kaggle that anything about 75% in PIMA is a good model and have implemented the same code from the Kaggle dataset to get 79% accuracy.
